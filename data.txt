Europe is one of the seven continents, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe consists of 44 countries, with Russia being the largest by area and population (although part of it extends into Asia), and Vatican City being the smallest. Major countries include Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain. 
Europe has a rich history that has shaped global culture, politics, and economies, from the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations to the Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, and World Wars. The European Union (EU), a political and economic union of 27 member states, plays a significant role in shaping modern Europe's governance, trade, and international relations.
Culturally diverse, Europe is home to many languages, traditions, and religions, with Christianity being the most prevalent. The continent is known for its historical landmarks, art, music, and literature, as well as its technological and scientific advancements. Europe is also a hub for education and research, hosting some of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities.
Economically, Europe is one of the largest and most developed markets in the world, with strong industries in finance, technology, automotive, and manufacturing. Major cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome are key global centers for commerce, culture, and diplomacy.
